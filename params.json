Most components speak to other components through\r\ninterfaces and can therefore be swapped out as needed. For example, a custom\r\nwindow class can be created for use with the Game class by either subclassing\r\nthe standard GameWindow class or implementing the interface IGameWindow.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
